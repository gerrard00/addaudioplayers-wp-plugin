# addaudioplayers-wp-plugin 

A super simple WordPress plugin that adds a bit of JavaScript to your pages. The script finds links to audio files (well, MP3 files right now) that don't have a corresponding audio player on the page and adds an audio player for them.

I'll add support for other audio formats, detecting HTML5 audio player support in the browser, customizing the location of the player and maybe a fancy custom player at some point.

To install, click the "Download ZIP" button on your right and install using your WordPress dashboard.
